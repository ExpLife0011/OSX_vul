Issue 17:	OS X IOKit kernel code execution due to lack of bounds checking in IOAccel2DContext2::blit

IOAccel2DContext2::blit is implemented in IOAcceleratorFamily2.kext - the vulnerable code can be reached from the chrome GPU process sandbox and the safari renderer sandbox.

The kernel code fails to validate an index passed from userspace which is used to index an array of pointers to Surfaces.

Provided a suitable structure can be constructed in kernel memory this bug can be leveraged for code execution since the code will call an attacker controller function pointer.

See attached blit.c for a crashing poc.
