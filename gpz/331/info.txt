Issue 331:	OS X IOKit kernel code execution due to lack of bounds checking in IGAccelVideoContextMain::process_token_JPEGBLF

The function IGAccelVideoContextMain::process_token_JPEGBLF trusts the dword at offset 0x14 in the input token and uses it as the index for a kernel memory write.

This PoC looks for a MediaKernel token and moves a few things around to trigger the vuln in the JPEGBLF code.

tested on: MacBookAir5,2 w/ 10.10.3 (14D131)
build: clang -Wall -dynamiclib -o ig_JPEGBLF.dylib ig_JPEGBLF.c -framework IOKit -arch i386 -arch x86_64
run: DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=./ig_JPEGBLF.dylib  /Applications/QuickTime\ Player.app/Contents/MacOS/QuickTime\ Player
go File -> New Movie Recording and press the red record button

Reachable from sandboxes which can talk to the GPU (eg chrome GPU process and safari renderer process.)

CVE-2015-3698
