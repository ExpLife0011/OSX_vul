MacOS/iOS kernel memory corruption due to bad bounds checking in necp_client_copy_interface

necp_client_copy_interface contains this code where interface_index is an attacker controlled
uint32_t:

  if (interface_index != IFSCOPE_NONE && (int)interface_index <= if_index) {
    interface = ifindex2ifnet[interface_index];
  }

This leads to an interface pointer being read out of bounds. This can lead to kernel memory disclosure
and also memory corruption as a lock is taken on the interface object.

tested on MacOS 10.12.3 (16D32) on MacbookAir5,2
