OS X exploitable kernel NULL dereference in IOAccelSharedUserClient2::page_off_resource

IOAccelerator external method IOAccelSharedUserClient2::page_off_resource uses the pointer at this+0x100 without checking if it's NULL.
A series of dereferences from this pointer lead to trivial RIP control.

We can race two threads, in one call the external method and in the other call IOServiceClose, which NULLs out the pointer at
this+0x100.

By mapping the NULL page into userspace we can control the pointer read.

tested on OS X 10.11.4 (15E65) on MacBookAir 5,2
