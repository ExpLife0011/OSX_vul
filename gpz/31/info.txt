Issue 31:	OS X IOKit kernel code execution due to NULL pointer dereference in IOAccelContext2::clientMemoryForType

Calling IOConnectMapMemory with type=0 of userclient 0x100 of IOService "IntelAccelerator" hits the following exploitable kernel NULL pointer dereference:

 mov rdi, [r12+1D8h]      ; rdi := NULL
 mov rax, [rdi]           ; read vtable pointer from NULL
 call qword ptr [rax+20h] ; controlled call

See attached PoC which maps the NULL page and kernel panics calling a virtual function near 0x4141414141414141.

This userclient is reachable from the chrome GPU process sandbox and the safari renderer sandbox.
