OS X Kernel code execution due to lack of bounds checking in AppleUSBPipe::Abort

External Method 36 of IOUSBInterfaceUserClient is _AbortStreamPipe.

It takes two scalar inputs and uses the second one as an array index to read a pointer
to a C++ object without checking the bounds then calls a virtual method on it.

Furthermore there's no check that the array pointer is non-null; if it is then we can get a
controlled offset-from-zero read; since our controlled dword will be multiplied by 8 to
index the array this means we can easily get the kernel to dereference a controllable
userspace address.

In this case a value of 0xf0f0f0f0 leads to the kernel reading an IOKit object pointer from
0x787878780. This poc maps that page to demonstrate control of a kernel object pointer.
