Issue 329:	OS X IOKit kernel code execution due to lack of bounds checking in IGAccelVideoContextMedia::process_token_JPEGDecode

IGAccelVideoContextMedia is the userclient used for GPU accelerated media decoding on the Intel HD integrated GPUs.
It's userclient 0x101 of the IntelAccelerator IOService. IOConnectMapMemory type=0 of this userclient is a shared token buffer. Token 0x8e is JPEGDecode, implemented in IGAccelVideoContextMedia::process_token_JPEGDecode

The dword at offset 0x8 of this token is used to compute the offset
for a write without checking the bounds, allowing a controlled kernel memory write.

Compile this dylib:
  $ clang -Wall -dynamiclib -o ig_video_media_jpegdecode.dylib ig_video_media_jpegdecode.c -framework IOKit -arch i386 -arch x86_64 
Load it into Quicktime:
  $ DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=./ig_video_media_jpegdecode.dylib /Applications/QuickTime\ Player.app/Contents/MacOS/QuickTime\ Player

Impact:
This userclient can be instantiated from the Chrome GPU process sandbox and the Safari renderer sandbox

tested on: MacBookAir5,2 w/ 10.10.3/14D131
