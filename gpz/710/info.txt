OS X Kernel use-after-free in AppleKeyStore

The AppleKeyStore userclient uses an IOCommandGate to serialize access to its userclient methods, however
by racing two threads, one of which closes the userclient (which frees the IOCommandGate)
and one of which tries to make an external method call we can cause a use-after-free of the IOCommandGate.

Tested on OS X 10.11.3 El Capitan 15D21 on MacBookAir5,2

CVE-2016-1755
