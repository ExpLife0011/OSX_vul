Issue 24:	OS X IOKit kernel code execution due to NULL pointer dereference in IOThunderboltFamily

IOThunderboltFamilyUserClient::xDomainRequestAction doesn't verify that a pointer is non-NULL before calling a virtual function, giving trivial kernel RIP control if the user process maps the NULL page, as this PoC demonstrates.

IOThunderboltFamilyUserClient::xDomainRequestAction is called by IOThunderboltFamilyUserClient::xDomainRequest which is selector 13 of IOThunderboltController

This bug appears to have been fixed, though I wasn't notified. I've emailed Apple to find out if it was a collision with an internal find or not.
