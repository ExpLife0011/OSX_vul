Issue 232:	OS X sandbox escape due to fontd trusting client-supplied pointers

The bug is pretty simple - the com.apple.FontObjectsServer method with msgh_id 0x2c calls DoHandleXTURLActionMessage which
treats the first qword in the controlled mach message payload as an objective-c object pointer. This makes no sense and
is pretty trivial to turn into reliable arbitrary code execution.

com.apple.FontObjectsServer is implemented in libATSServer.dylib which is loaded in the fontd process.
fontd isn't sandboxed and it's reachable from most sandboxes including safari and chrome renderers.

This PoC will run the shell command you give it below as a regular, unsandboxed user. Build it as a dylib
to easily load it inside a sandboxed process to demonstrate the impact.

PoC tested on Yosemite 10.10.1 - a bunch of offsets are hardcoded for that version, you will have to fix the ROP for other versions.
