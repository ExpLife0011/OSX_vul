OS X exploitable kernel NULL pointer dereference in AppleGraphicsDeviceControl

AppleGraphicsDeviceControlClient doesn't check that its pointer to its IOService (at this+0xd8) is non-null before using it
in all external methods.

We can set this pointer to NULL by racing two threads, one of which calls IOServiceClose which NULLs out the pointer and the
other of which makes any external method call.

By mapping the NULL page in userspace this gives us trivial kernel RIP control as the code makes a virtual call on a NULL object pointer.
