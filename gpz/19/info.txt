ssue 19:	OS X IOKit kernel code execution due to unchecked pointer parameter in IGAccelCLContext::unmap_user_memory

The Intel OpenCL IOKit userclient has pretty much exactly the same bug as the OpenGL one - they trust a user-supplied pointer and call a virtual function off of it.

Specifically the function IGAccelCLContext::unmap_user_memory is reachable as selector 0x101.

Attached poc hello.c (uses the apple OpenCL hello world example to initialize OpenCL and get the correct userclient) will kernel panic dereferencing 0x4141414141414141. Compile with -framework OpenCL -framework IOKit

This should be reachable from the chrome gpu process sandbox and the safari renderer sandbox.
