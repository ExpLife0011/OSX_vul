	OS X exploitable kernel NULL pointer dereference in nvCommandQueue::GetHandleIndex in GeForce.kext

The method nvCommandQueue::GetHandleIndex doesn't check whether this+0x5b8 is non-null before using it.

We can race a call to this method this with another thread calling IOServiceClose to get a NULL pointer there.

By mapping the NULL page in userspace this gives us trivial kernel RIP control as the code makes a virtual call on a NULL object pointer.
