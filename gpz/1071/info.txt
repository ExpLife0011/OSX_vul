MacOS kernel code execution due to lack of bounds checking in AppleIntelCapriController::GetLinkConfig

Selector 0x921 of IntelFBClientControl ends up in AppleIntelCapriController::GetLinkConfig

This method takes a structure input and output buffer. It reads an attacker controlled dword from the input buffer which it
uses to index an array of pointers with no bounds checking:

This pointer is passed to AppleIntelFramebuffer::validateDisplayMode and the uint64 at offset +2130h is used as a C++ object pointer
on which a virtual method is called. With some heap grooming this could be used to get kernel code execution.

tested on MacOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C67)
